# This script create a set of report pdf files using the images generated with the
#Participation report script.
# It needs that in the DESTINATION FOLDER:

# 1) one .txt file named "IDs_correspondence.txt", with correspondence between IDs and initial words
#(lile NP801	Matteo	o). Tab as separator. and three values 
# a) folder with figures name, b) name of the participant c) o or a, to adjust the report for gender.

# 2) a set of report Figure as obrained by the MAtlab script (in a folder to be set as SOURCE_FOLDER).

# 3) the Figure "forward_inverse.jpeg" or any other figure to be 

# 4) a Report_template.tex file, to be located in the Destination folder.




# It work like this. 
# I take the correspondence specified in IDs_correspondence.txt and substitute them in a .tex file
# that is compiled with pdflatex and filled with the path changed in every compilation (via regular expression).
# (e.g., SUBJ_FOLDER is replaecd with NP801).

# (two key things: extract array

# This script copy the segmented MRI from a source folder to the appropriate destination folder
# based on an indices file, that is expected to be contained in the destination folder

## insert here the path with Report Figures (with one folder for each subject)
SOURCE_FOLDER=/Users/giorgioarcara/Documents/Prove_CODE_Giorgio/PDF_reports/Figures


# insert here the path with the project folder
DESTINATION_FOLDER=/Users/giorgioarcara/Documents/Prove_CODE_Giorgio/PDF_reports

# create two folders
mkdir -p $DESTINATION_FOLDER/Temp_Folder
mkdir -p $DESTINATION_FOLDER/Final_PDFs

# clone the original data (to be erased later)
